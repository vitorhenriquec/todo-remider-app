# todo-remider-app (V 1.0.0)
A app that reminds you of some task. It uses the api from this [link](https://todo-esig.herokuapp.com/api/v1/task) and follows the same idea from this [link](https://5e263f0458023c000862b4bc--jovial-hodgkin-7cfb63.netlify.com/).

The API GitHub's project is [here](https://github.com/vitorhenriquec/todo) and the ReactFront's project is here [here](https://github.com/vitorhenriquec/todo-react).

##Functionalities

The functionalities are:
- List all tasks from the API;
- Add a task (when the add button is tapped);
- Update status from task (when a task id tapped);
- Remove a task (when a task in long pressed).
